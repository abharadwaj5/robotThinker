## What I do

### Simulation-driven robotics & autonomous systems
- Build **dynamic**, **discrete-event**, and **scenario** simulations for complex machines and autonomous workflows.
- Develop **digital twins** using modular system architectures (state machines, task sequencing, planning logic).
- Validate simulation behavior against real-world data (timing/synchronisation, logs, metrics) to improve fidelity.
- Run comparative experiments across scenarios to quantify performance and support design decisions.

### Embedded systems & IoT innovation
- Develop firmware and system software in **Embedded C/C++** and work within **Embedded Linux** environments.
- Integrate sensors and real-time data acquisition for robust, testable prototypes and deployed systems.
- Build IoT-ready pipelines and device communication using common interfaces and protocols (**SPI / UART / I2C**, plus CAN/MQTT when applicable).

### Applied machine learning for engineering
- Use Python-based ML methods to extract insight from datasets and support engineering decisions:
  - **Random Forest**
  - **Linear Regression**
- Apply ML for parameter tuning, trend detection, and improving simulation calibration workflows.

### Engineering delivery & collaboration
- Create clear scientific documentation and maintainable codebases (Git workflows, review-friendly structure).
- Build test procedures, diagnostics, and log-based debugging habits for reliable iteration and deployment.
