## SkillForAction (Horizon 2020)
**Virtual Driver Model** for harvesting scenarios and prediction of fuel consumption and CO2 emissions  
Website: https://etnskillforaction.com/

### Summary
Built and integrated discrete-event simulation components as part of an experimentable digital twin environment for forestry operations.

### What I did
- Designed discrete-event simulations of harvesting tasks, including individual harvester operation.
- Integrated real machine data (CAN-bus, positional data, joystick logs) for accurate time synchronization.
- Built a modular simulation testbed with interacting machine, forest, and terrain models.
- Ran scenarios and extracted metrics to support estimation/validation of fuel and emissions models.

### Digital Twin Components
- **Forest Digital Twin (FDT):** tree dimensions/species + geo-location
- **Terrain Digital Twin (TDT):** terrain models (DTM), slope, soil type/moisture
- **Machine Digital Twin (MDT):** operational logic + telemetry (rpm, fuel usage, torque)

## OUTREACH
Website: https://www.mmi.rwth-aachen.de/projekt/outreach/

### Summary
Coordination of heterogeneous forestry machines (e.g., harvesters with different crane arm lengths) operating in the same environment, aiming to reduce overlap and improve efficiency.

### What I did
- Reconstructed a realistic simulation of a harvested forest site.
- Designed experiments with two harvesters with varied reach capabilities.
- Modeled coordination logic for task allocation and spatial positioning.
- Evaluated efficiency using travel time and task distribution metrics.

## Clean Room Calibration of PM Sensor for Pollution Monitoring
### Summary
Developed and calibrated a stand-alone particulate matter (PM) sensing setup across environmental conditions, comparing low-cost sensors (Shinyei PPD2NS, Sensirion SPS30) and calibrating SPS30 in cleanroom and regular environments.

### Results
- ~95% match between cleanroom-calibrated data and certified reference data (Particle Technology)
- Reported >90% calibration accuracy

## Bachelor Thesis: Smart Irrigation using Raspberry Pi and IoT
### Summary
Built an irrigation system using soil moisture, temperature, and pH sensors, with relay-based automation through a Raspberry Pi and cloud-based monitoring.

### Notable Feature
Mixed “water” and “medicine” in a **60:40 ratio** using timing across two relay-controlled flows.
